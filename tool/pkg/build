# * look up hash of the source package from the src recipe
# * look for source package, stop if it does not exist
# * look for src/api to determine whether to build a library or a target
# * if building a library, concatenate pkg name as <apihash>/<srchash>
# * if building a target, set pkg name to <srchash>
# * create pkg directory, which corrsponds to a Genode build directory
# * configure the build.conf
#   * REPOSITORIES point to the source package and all used api packages
#     the list of used api packages comes from the '<srcdir>/used_apis'
#     file. Validate that all APIs exist before issueing the build
# * start the build system, distinguish the building of libraries from
#   the building of target packages:
#   * Libraries: make LIB=<pkgname>
#   * Targets;   make (build all targets present in the source package)
