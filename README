                Package-management infrastructure for Genode
                ============================================


This repository hosts the tools and package descriptions intended for the
distribution of Genode-based operating systems. More information about the
Genode OS Framework are available at the project website [1].

At the current stage, this repository is merely an experimentation ground.
If you encounter bugs, build problems, or stability issues, please report them
to the Genode mailing list [2].

Usage
-----

* Clone nfeske's Genode repository to the root of the genode-pkg repository.
  Alternatively, you may create a symbolic link called "genode" that points
  to the Genode source tree.

  ! git clone https://github.com/nfeske/genode.git genode

* Checkout the 'pkg' branch that contains a few supplemental build-system
  features not yet avaiable in Genode's master branch:

  ! cd genode
  ! git checkout pkg
  ! cd ..

* Create an API package for the 'ld' library:

  ! ./tool/api/create ld

  The recipe for the API package is taken from _recipes/api/ld/_. The
  resulting API package is generated to _export/api/ld-<api-hash>/_.

* Create a source package for 'libc', which uses the 'ld' API and, in turn,
  implements the 'libc' API:

  ! ./tool/src/create libc

  The recipe for the source package is taken from _recipes/src/libc/_.
  The source package is generated at _export/src/libc-<src-hash>/_.


Work in progress
----------------

* Tool for building a binary package (the first fragments are located
  at _tool/pkg/build_)
