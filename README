                Package-management infrastructure for Genode
                ============================================


This repository hosts the tools and package descriptions intended for the
distribution of Genode-based operating systems. More information about the
Genode OS Framework are available at the project website [1].

At the current stage, this repository is merely an experimentation ground.
If you encounter bugs, build problems, or stability issues, please report them
to the Genode mailing list [2].

Usage
-----

* Clone nfeske's Genode repository to the root of the genode-pkg repository.
  Alternatively, you may create a symbolic link called "genode" that points
  to the Genode source tree.

  ! git clone https://github.com/nfeske/genode.git genode

* Checkout the 'pkg' branch that contains a few supplemental build-system
  features not yet avaiable in Genode's master branch:

  ! cd genode
  ! git checkout pkg
  ! cd ..

* Create an API packages for the 'so', 'ld', and 'libc' libraries. The
  'ld' library is the dynamic linker providing the Genode API. The 'so'
  library contains initialization support for shared objects. It is used
  by all libraries.

  ! ./tool/api/create so
  ! ./tool/api/create ld
  ! ./tool/api/create libc

  The recipe for the API package is taken from _recipes/api/ld/_. The
  resulting API package is generated to _export/api/ld-<api-hash>/_.

* Create a source package for 'libc', which uses the 'ld' API and, in turn,
  implements the 'libc' API:

  ! ./tool/src/create libc

  The recipe for the source package is taken from _recipes/src/libc/_.
  The source package is generated at _export/src/libc-<src-hash>/_.

* Build libc package

  ! ./tool/pkg/build -j4 libc SPEC=x86_32
